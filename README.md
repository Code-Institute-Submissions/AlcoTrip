## UX/Design

> This project was developed focusing on Desktop and Tablet screens, cause they're mostly skipped in mobile phone era.
However mobile phone design were carefully considered. Clear and simple design is really effective.
Users can see all important information from the very begining, also it's giving them easy access to all features.

#### Logo and Name
* Logo was created especialy for this project purpouse. It has two words "Alco" - alcohol and "Trip".\
Name stands for trip with alcohol.\
<span style="color:red">( Remember, you can drink alcohol only when you're more than 18 years old! )</span>\
Logo also has a thunder sign which was created in photoshop. It is a simbolical meaning of shock you can get when you are to drunk.

#### Coloristic
* Blue tonned background is good for bright and dark screens.
* I've used two contrasting colors yellow and white. These colors "stands out" from the bakground and they are making design more clear and readable for users.
* Dark red color has been used for buttons highlightining only to notify users about canceling or reseting values.

#### Font
* I've used is <strong>Roboto</strong>, it's well design, simple and easy to read. [See font](https://fonts.google.com/?query=Roboto){:target="_blank"}\
The second replacing font is <strong>San-Serif</strong>.
* Different font weight was used to manipulate which part of text should be spotted as a first by the user.

#### Buttons and Sliders
* All buttons and sliders have rounded corners style for a better look. They have a flat not strong shadow to make them more 3D.

#### Sidebar
* Is placed on the left side of the page. It has litte arrows to minimize or maximize the view to see more on the map.
* Colored marks with names and sliders will help the users to localize and distinguish between premises more specifcally.

#### Map
* Created with Google Maps API is placed in responsive container. 
* Red marker with user position is always in page center to help localize.

#### Wireframes

* Desktops [view](){:target="_blank"}
* Tablets  [view](){:target="_blank"}
* Phones   [view](){:target="_blank"}

## Testing
Website code was tested by copying link to [Validator](https://validator.w3.org/){:target="_blank"} - W3C Markup Validation Service.
 - All errors have been checked, reviewed and fixed.

This project was mainly tested in Chrome.\
I've used Chrome Extensions 
[Viewport Resizer â€“ Responsive Testing Tool](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/viewport-resizer-%E2%80%93-respon/kapnjjcfcncngkadhpmijlkblpibdcgm){:target="_blank"},
to check responsiveness of the site, pages layout change, how all elements are animating on a different screen sizes.
 * Based on all checks I've made changes to make navigation, fields, sliders and page layout more user friendly and easy to use to provide better user experience.

Website responsiveness and element animating also was tested on diferrent browsers such as IE and Safari.

##### Main page:
* Clicking on each element including logotype icon to make sure, all elements works and react correctly.
* After clicking on "Find Me!" - empty input field should show postcode found via using postcode.io API. 

Some display issues were found with browsers: IE and Safari, regarding using SASS.
